## Line Detectiors and Line Drivers
The very basic functionality of these blocks is to synchronize the input differential lines with the physical layer clock.
Based on the negotiation identifies the then it identifies the serial logic and transmit it to furture blocks in a receiver path.
Similarly in a transmition path based on the negotiation made the serial logic is converted in to differential logic and is farwarded to the analog for strengthen it.
